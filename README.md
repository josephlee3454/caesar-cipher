* Today we’ll be tackling a cryptographic classic - the Caesar Cipher.
# feature tasks
* Create an encrypt function that takes in a plain text phrase and a numeric shift.
* the phrase will then be shifted that many letters.
* E.g. encrypt(‘abc’,1) would return ‘bcd’ = E.g. encrypt(‘acb’, 10) would return ‘klm’
* shifts that exceed 26 should wrap around
* E.g. encrypt(‘abc’,27) would return ‘bcd’
* Create a decrypt method that takes in encrypted text and numeric shift which will restore the encrypted text back to its original form as long as correct key is supplied.
* Break the cipher so that an encrypted message can be transformed into its original state WITHOUT access to the key.
* Devise a method for the computer to determine if code was broken with minimal human guidance.
